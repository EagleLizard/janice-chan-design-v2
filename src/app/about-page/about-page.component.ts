  name: 'JANICE CHAN',
  bio: 'Janice Chan is a scenic designer based in Utah County, highly driven by storytelling and moved by conceptual art and surrealism. She holds a B.F.A. in Theatre Arts: Scenic Design from Utah Valley University, where earned the 2020 Outstanding Student Award from the School of the Arts. Her work primarily consists of design for the stage, with experience in scenic painting for Sundance Summer Theatre, Utah Renaissance Faire, and An Other Theater Company, and producing set draftings for theatrical and architectural designs. Janice is a graphic design enthusiast, frequently incorporating graphic elements in her show designs. She has a background in administration in academia and social media marketing. Janice enjoys exploring local natural scenery, eternally drawing inspiration from mountainscapes and finding beauty in the mundane, and not labelling herself as a foodie*. She is committed to projects that serve marginalized communities, and supports safe and accessible entertainment practices during the pandemic and beyond. Janice is a first-generation immigrant from Hong Kong and Melbourne, Australia, and currently resides in the fastest growing city in Utah.',
